            You may use this map <b>or</b> <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/local-governments/facts-framework/local-government-maps">this Local Government Boundaries map</a> to find out if your property lies within the boundaries of a specific municipality. However, please note that the legal municipal boundaries do change from time to time and there is no guarantee that the map you see right now would reflect the legal municipal boundaries at the time the annual speculation and vacancy tax declaration letters are sent.

            This map is provided for information purposes only. If your property is in a speculation and vacancy tax area and you are subject to the tax, you can expect to receive a declaration letter at the beginning of each year.
